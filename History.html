        <p>After meeting at University College London, Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland formed the band Coldplay in London in 1996. Guy Berryman and Will Champion joined the band soon after. The band was first known as "Starfish," but it was later changed to Coldplay. Their success came in 2000 with the release of "Parachutes," their debut album, which included hits like "Yellow." Since then, Coldplay was known for their emotional and energetic songs. They have since established themselves as one of the most important artists in the music industry with their release of new albums and winning multiple awards.</p>
