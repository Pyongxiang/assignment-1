Design process:

For my website, I got inspiration from the actual coldplay website, with its colour scheme and design. This way, it can appeal to the coldplay fans as the colour scheme makes the website very welcoming.

Existing features:
For the homepage, Feature 1: It showcases the new tour with the button 'Buy tickets' which will lead them to the tour page. 
Feature 2: On the bottom right of the page, it has coldplay's social media by clicking on it

For the store page, Feature 3: It has an image slider to showcase the different promotions and offers on the merch

For the music page, Feature 4: It has a youtube mini player where users can watch the official music video on the website itself, however, the video is unplayable even though the code is correct as youtube forbids embedding some videos in a local host environment.

Feature 5: It has a spotify button which will lead to the spotify song page for users to listen to it directly.
